- Demo UI using Gradio

How to use:
For new users:

Tick New to FuKaKukku checkbox and type your new user name to register
Untick New to FUKKAKUKKU and Re-submit
The Recommender System will give you items you might like.
For registered users:

Type your username to the textbox and the Recommender System will do the rest.
Of course this demo is solely for demo purpose, as the name suggested. We can not rate items using this interface as Gradio module has its own limit.
